## About
post-it provides an interactive platform for writers to find inspiration, fostering a community of writers regardless of level. The website is easy to navigate, and serves as a fantastic starting point for writers to push their creativity and engage with others, as well as a resource for those who are struggling with ideas and writerâ€™s block. This project was developed by Erica Dong, Armaan Priyadarshan, Vishal Balagani, and Rohan Sarikonda for HackDartmouth X.
